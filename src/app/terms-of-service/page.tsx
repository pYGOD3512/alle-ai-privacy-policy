                    Alle-AI integrates various third-party AI models, including ChatGPT, Bard, Claude, Dalle-E, Stable Difusion, 
                    Midjourney, and others. While we strive to provide the best user experience, we do not guarantee the availability, 
                    accuracy, or performance of these models. The providers of these AI models also operate these models on their 
                    respective platforms. The AI models we provide on Alle-AI run on similar engines as the models on their respective 
                    platforms but may not be identical to the versions hosted on their respective platforms. We have tailored their 
                    implementations to suit the Alle-AI environment while maintaining their high-quality performance.
